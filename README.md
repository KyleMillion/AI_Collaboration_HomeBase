# AI Collaboration Home Base

This directory serves as the central hub for all collaborative projects undertaken with your AI Partner.

## Purpose

The primary goal of this Home Base is to:
- Provide a structured and organized environment for project development.
- Centralize shared documentation, templates, and best practices.
- Streamline the initiation and management of new projects.
- Ensure consistency and adherence to our agreed-upon methodologies (see `docs/methodologies`).

## Structure Overview

- `README.md`: This file.
- `docs/`: Shared documentation, guidelines, and tool guides.
- `templates/`: Boilerplate templates for new projects.
- `projects/`: Container for all individual development projects.
- `scripts/`: Shared utility scripts and tooling configurations.
- `config/`: Templates or examples for configuration files.

## Getting Started with a New Project

Refer to `templates/` and the guidance in `docs/methodologies/` to initiate a new project within this framework.
