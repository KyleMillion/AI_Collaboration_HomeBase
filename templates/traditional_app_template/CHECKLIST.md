# Traditional App Development Checklist

This checklist is derived from the "Roadmap for Creating a Fully Functional (Traditional) App" as defined in our `../../docs/methodologies/OUR_COLLABORATION_CHARTER.md`. Use this to track progress and ensure all necessary steps are considered for your project.

## Phase 1: Ideation & Planning (The "Why" and "What")
- [ ] **1.1. Define the Problem & Solution:**
    - [ ] Clearly articulate the problem your app solves.
    - [ ] Define your unique value proposition.
- [ ] **1.2. Identify Target Audience:**
    - [ ] Create user personas (detailed descriptions of your ideal users).
    - [ ] Understand their needs, pain points, and technical savviness.
- [ ] **1.3. Market Research & Competitor Analysis:**
    - [ ] Identify existing solutions and competitors.
    - [ ] Analyze their strengths, weaknesses, and market positioning.
    - [ ] Find your niche or differentiator.
- [ ] **1.4. Define Core Features (MVP - Minimum Viable Product):**
    - [ ] List all desired features.
    - [ ] Prioritize ruthlessly to define the absolute essential features for the first version.
    - [ ] Document these as user stories (e.g., "As a \[user type], I want to \[action] so that \[benefit]").
- [ ] **1.5. Monetization Strategy (if applicable):**
    - [ ] How will the app generate revenue (e.g., paid, freemium, ads, subscription)?
- [ ] **1.6. Initial Technical Feasibility & Resource Assessment:**
    - [ ] High-level assessment: Can this be built with available/learnable tech?
    - [ ] Rough estimate of time, cost, and skills needed.

## Phase 2: Requirements & Detailed Analysis (The "How")
- [ ] **2.1. Functional Requirements:**
    - [ ] Detailed specification of what the app must do.
    - [ ] Derived from user stories (e.g., user registration, data input, report generation).
- [ ] **2.2. Non-Functional Requirements:**
    - [ ] How the app should perform (e.g., performance speed, security standards, scalability, usability, reliability, accessibility).

    - [ ] User Flows: Map out how users will navigate through the app to complete tasks.
    - [ ] Wireframes: Low-fidelity skeletal outlines of each screen, focusing on layout and functionality.
    - [ ] Prototypes: Interactive mockups (clickable wireframes or more polished designs) to test user flows and gather feedback.
- [ ] **3.2. UI (User Interface) Design:**
    - [ ] Visual Design: Color schemes, typography, iconography, branding elements.
    - [ ] Style Guide: A document outlining all visual design rules.
    - [ ] High-Fidelity Mockups: Detailed visual representations of each screen.
- [ ] **3.3. System Architecture Design:**
    - [ ] Component Diagram: Break down the app into modules/services.
    - [ ] Database Schema Design: Define tables, fields, relationships.
    - [ ] API Design (if applicable): Define endpoints, request/response formats for communication between frontend and backend, or with third-party services.
- [ ] **3.4. Security Design:**
    - [ ] Plan for authentication, authorization, data encryption, input validation, etc.

## Phase 4: Development (The "Building")

    - [ ] Build APIs.
    - [ ] Set up and configure the database.
    - [ ] Implement business rules.
- [ ] **4.3. Frontend Development:**
    - [ ] Translate UI designs into functional code (HTML, CSS, JavaScript, or native mobile code).
    - [ ] Connect frontend to backend APIs.
    - [ ] Ensure responsiveness across devices/screen sizes.
- [ ] **4.4. Database Implementation:**
    - [ ] Create the database according to the schema.
    - [ ] Write queries and procedures.
- [ ] **4.5. Integration of Third-Party Services:**
    - [ ] Payment gateways, social logins, analytics, mapping services, etc.
- [ ] **4.6. Implement Security Measures:**
    - [ ] As per security design.
- [ ] **4.7. Write Unit Tests & Integration Tests:**
    - [ ] Test individual components and how they work together.
- [ ] **4.8. Code Reviews:**
    - [ ] Have another developer review code for quality, standards, and bugs.
- [ ] **4.9. Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment (CI/CD) Setup (Recommended):**
    - [ ] Automate building, testing, and deploying code changes.
